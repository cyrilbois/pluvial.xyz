# About this app

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) app. You can make your own by typing the following into your command line and following the prompts:

```
npm init svelte@next
```

The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or opening the devtools network panel and reloading.
